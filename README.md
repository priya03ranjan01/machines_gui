# electrical_machines_gui_team_project
This is a GUI project created in Python.
It plots the OCC and ZPF characteristics from the data sets given by the user for a 3 phase cylindrical rotor synchronous machine.
After reading the data, the algorithm also constructs Potier triangle and finds out leakage reactance and armature reaction reactance of the machine.

The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>Python
<li>Tensorflow
<li>Deep Learning
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
