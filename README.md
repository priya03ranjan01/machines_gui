# electrical_machines_gui_team_project
This is a GUI project created in Python and its libraries.
It plots the OCC and ZPF characteristics from the data sets given by the user for a 3 phase cylindrical rotor synchronous machine.
After reading the data, the algorithm also constructs Potier triangle and finds out leakage reactance and armature reaction reactance of the machine.

The project was guided by Dr. Shubhobrata Rudra.<br>
The other teams mates include:
<li>Madhushmita Barik
<li>Annesha Sahu
<li>Amanjeet Pani<br>

I got to learn a lot during the period this project making.<br>
Each one played their different roles diligently making the overall results fruitful.
<br>
<br>The libraries used in this project are:
<li>matplotlib
<li>numpy
<li>tkinter
<li>scipy
<li>shapely
<li>pandas  <br>
We also created a ppt to elaborate the algorithm and theory used in the project.
