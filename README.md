# electrical_machines_gui_team_project
This is a GUI project created using Python and its different libraries.<br>
It plots the OCC and ZPF characteristics from the data set asked from the user for a 3 phase cylindrical rotor synchronous machine.
After reading the data, the algorithm also constructs Potier triangle and finds out leakage reactance and armature reaction reactance of the machine.

<br>The libraries used in this project are:
<li>matplotlib
<li>numpy
<li>tkinter
<li>scipy
<li>shapely
<li>pandas  <br>
  
The project was guided by Dr. Shubhobrata Rudra.<br>
The other teams mates include:
<li>Madhushmita Barik
<li>Annesha Sahu
<li>Amanjeet Pani<br>

I got to learn a lot during the period of the project making.<br>
Each one played their different roles diligently making the overall results fruitful.
<br>

We also created a ppt to elaborate the algorithm and theory used in the project.
